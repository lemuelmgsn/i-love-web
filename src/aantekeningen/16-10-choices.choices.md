good and cheap = slow

alle drie is niet mogelijk

on what scale/how many users
computational cost = cost energy

the tech u use doesn't matter, end users dont matter

youre going to make shitty decisions
  really engage with that and own it and make better decisions
  
Root your decisions in user needs
  we need to maintain it, build code
  
Consider their needs
